Welcome to the Python class at The Iron Yard in Greenville! We are going to have a very exciting
semester.  Before class, you're going to need to do a few things to get ready:

* [Get and setup your Mac](setup)
* [Read through the syllabus](syllabus)
* [Complete your prework](prework)

The prework will take you quite some time -- probably around 40 hours -- so don't wait until the
last minute to start it. It is due one week before class on February 1st.
